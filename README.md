# Intention of the Application

Application created for personal use and cannot be used for commercial purposes.
It is written in Python and greetings are warmly welcomed.

### Main App Functionality:

-   Downloading videos from YouTube: The application allows the downloading of
    YouTube videos in MP4 format. The user enters the URL of the video and the
    application downloads it to the local drive.

-   Converting videos to MP3 format: Once a video has been downloaded, the app
    can convert it to MP3 format. This is particularly useful if the user wants
    to listen to music from a YouTube video on a device that only supports
    audio.

-   User interface: The app has a simple and intuitive user interface. The user
    enters the URL of the video or playlist, selects the download and conversion
    option and the app does the rest of the work.

-   Safety: The app does not download age-restricted films, ensuring safety for
    younger users.

-   Colour output: The app uses the colourama module to colour code the text in
    the console, making it easier for the user to understand what the app is
    doing.
